  <p>When sharing the result, keep in mind that some apps (so far I\'ve spotted Facebook) will not allow sharing both text and image - for such situations, the result is copied to clipboard before sharing. You\'ll need to PASTE it in the target app yourself.</p>

    <![CDATA[
  <p>When taking images of text (documents, invoices ...) try as much as possible to get good lighting conditions and proper focus.</p>
  <p>Image resolution is another factor that influences the correctness of the OCR process - higher resolutions will give better results at the expense of processing time.</p>
